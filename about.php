            History of Goldenstate College
        </h2>
        <p>
            &emsp; Demand for technical skills by the economic sector was growing. The Goldenstate Institute, aggressive to respond to
            this need, offered short-term industrial courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp; When it opened, the institution was manned by only seven administrative officials, twenty-nine instructors, 
            and 160 students. Five years later, the administrative staff and instructors increased to forty-eight. Their efforts 
            and expertise were dedicated to meet the needs of the increasing student population.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp; In the year 1997, the Goldenstate Institute occupied two building spaces which became the venues for academic training, and 
            specific practicum and classroom instructions. The institution started its operation with only 7 vocational courses 
            and 5 non-formal courses. The same courses were offered with two more additional courses: Computer Secretarial and
            Architectural Drafting.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp; With the increasing demand for supply of technically-skilled men and women here and abroad, Goldenstate continues to 
            upgrade and enhance its training program proficiency in order to produce graduates who can be productive and efficient 
            in the professional world. This, along with fulfilling its educational mission in nation building, 
            is the guiding philosophy of the Goldenstate Institute as it envisions a society where constituents live fruitfully and
            productively within the context of an economically productive society. In the year 2001, the Board of Trustees decided to
            change its organization's name from Goldenstate Institute, Inc to Goldenstate College, Inc and applied degree courses
            from the Commission of Higher Education. Fortunately, the school was granted permit to operate Bachelor of Science in Tourism,
            Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management, and Bachelor of Science Commerce, Major in Business Management.
            In 2006, the Goldenstate College was fortunately granted permit to operate Bachelor of Science in Business 
            Administration and BS Tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
            &emsp; Currently, the Goldenstate College of Koronadal offers a variety of courses including BSHM, BSTM, BSIT, BSSW, ABE, 
            BECE, BTVED, BSBA, ACT, HM, and TESDA PROGRAMs.
